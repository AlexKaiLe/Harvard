Deep learning project analyzing rat behavior and their correlation with neurological activity. Utilized MATLAB to preprocess raw video data and developed Python scripts utilizing TensorFlow to construct a convolutional neural network to identify unmarked 3-dimensional points using spatial and temporal data. Developed a variational autoencoder to predict coordinates of missing joints not registered by raw video feed.
